Complete Ubuntu 14.04 local development environment setup guide for Drupal 7 & 8. Includes LAMP, git, Composer, Drush, and RVM. Also, a few optional applications are included. (Sublime Text 3, PhpStorm, Node.js, Gulp.js and HexChat) 

**LOCAL set up only!**  Ubuntu 14.04 / LAMP / Drupal Sites Setup

1. Ubuntu 14.04 Install
2. Lamp Stack Installation
3. Server Applications Setup
4. Apache Configuration
5. vhost Setup and Configuration
6. Hosts File Configuration
7. Database Creation And Drupal Installation
8. IDE Installation
9. Optional Applications

---

#1. Ubuntu 14.04 Install
1. Create a bootable install disk or usb drive, follow directions and install Ubuntu  
2. It is very important to write down or remember your username and password. You will use these on a regular basis  
3. Open a terminal, click on the top left icon and type: `terminal`
4. Run updates (don’t bother with the software updater). This takes a while:

	```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

5. If you want to use a text editor, it is called gedit. Open it the same way as the terminal. Once it is in the sidebar launcher, you can left click and lock.  
6. You can also remove most of the other annoying icons from the launcher so they are not in your way.  

####Give Your User Permissions!

1. Add your username to the sudo group:

    ```bash
$ sudo adduser yourusername sudo
```

2. Add your username to the www-data group:

    ```bash
$ sudo adduser yourusername www-data
```

####Permission Issues

If you are having permission issues, you can also do the following. I do not believe this method is recommended.  

1. Edit the sudoers file with the "visudo" text editor:
**(This is much safer than editing the `/etc/sudoers` file manually).**

    ```bash
$ sudo visudo
```

2. Using the arrow keys, or the 'j' key,  scroll down until you see # User privilege specification
3. Place cursor under: `root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
4. Add: `yourusername ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
5. Press **Esc**
6. Type: `:wq`

___
#2. Lamp Stack Installation
* **[How to install Lamp server on ubuntu 14.04 by Krizna.com](http://www.krizna.com/ubuntu/install-lamp-server-ubuntu-14-04/)**

1. Install Apache:

    ```bash
$ sudo apt-get install apache2
``` 

2. Open Apache main configuration file:

    ```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

3. Use the arrow key to scroll down to the end of the file and type in: 
`ServerName localhost`  
4. Press **CTRL**+**o** (to save)  
5. Press **Enter**   
6. Press **CTRL**+**x** (to exit)  
7. You can check to make sure that it saved with

    ```bash
$ cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

8. Restart apache:

    ```bash
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```

9. Change the ownership of /var/www/html to your username

    ```bash
$ sudo chown yourusername:www-data /var/www/html -R
```

10. You can check to make sure it works properly by opening the browser and typing: */var/www/html*

---

###Install MySQL server
1. Install MySQL:

    ```bash
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

2. It will ask you to create a password. Generally for localhost it is root/root.   
3. Check the service status with:

    ```bash
$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql status
```

4. If your prompt is `mysql>` after checking the status, you can escape by typing: `exit`

---

###Install PHP
1. Install PHP: 

    ```bash
$ sudo apt-get install php5 php5-mysql
```  

2. Create a PHP file. 

    ```bash
$ sudo nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
```

3. Add the following code:  

    ```PHP
    <?php  
    
    phpinfo();
    
    ?>
    ```

4. Press **CTRL**+**o** (to save)  
5. Press **Enter**  
6. Press **CTRL**+**x** (to exit)  
7. Restart Apache:  

    ```bash
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```

8. Open browser and navigate to: *localhost/phpinfo.php*  

---

###Install phpMyAdmin
* **[How To Install and Secure phpMyAdmin on Ubuntu 14.04 by Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-14-04)**

1. Install phpMyAdmin:

    ```Bash
$ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
```

2. **Important!** Press the **spacebar** to choose Apache 2. An ***** will display.   
3. Press **Tab** (to navigate down the menu to <ok>)   
4. Press **Enter**  
5. Select *Yes* to configure with dbconfig-common  
6. Follow the rest with your password, and again *root* is a common password used for a local host
7. Activate the mcrpyt module:

    ```Bash
$ sudo php5enmod mcrypt
```

8. Restart Apache:

    ```Bash
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```

9. Test by navigating in the browser to: *localhost/phpmyadmin*  
10. You can follow the rest of the tutorial for additional securities if you want. I am not sure if this is necessary for local. Of course it would be for a cloud server  
11. Don’t *ever* do this on a live server but local is fine. Drupal php needs access:

    ```Bash
$ chmod 775 /var/www/html
```

####Increase Max Limit In php.ini
1. Open the PHP configuration file:
    
    ```Bash
$ sudo nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
```

2. Press **CTRL**+**w** (to search) and type `memory_limit`
3. Change to: `memory_limit = 512M`
4. Press **CTRL**+**o** (to save)  
5. Press **Enter**   
6. Press **CTRL**+**x** (to exit)  

---

###Create SSH key
**(you can replace keys with your old ones after initial set up)**

1. Change to root directory:

    ```Bash
$ cd ~
```

2. Creat .ssh directory:
    
    ```Bash
$ mkdir .ssh
```

3. Protect the directory against any access from other users, while you still has full access:

    ```Bash
$ chmod 700 .ssh
```

4. Create an RSA Key Pair:

    ```Bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

5. Press **Enter** three times (type a passphrase if you wish)  

Note: You will see the following messages to which you can just press enter:
```sh
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
```
```sh
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
```
```sh
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```

*Extra* - If you want your old keys - put your old keys on a usb drive, navigate to the .ssh folder and replace them

2. Change "foo" to your user. (If you are unsure of the name, type `pwd` in the command line):
    
    ```Bash
$ ln -s  /var/www/html /home/foo/sites
```

Now you can easily cd sites and you will be directly in the html folder

**Future note**: You can create and name a symlink wherever you like
* The first path is **what** you are linking
* The second path is **where** the link will be

Example:
    
```Bash
$ ln -s /what/is/being/linked /where/symlink/goes/nameofsymlink
```

To remove a symlink: unlink **sites** (symlink name)

#7. Database Creation And Drupal Installation
###Create Database And Site Via GUI/git
**(Scroll down for cli/Drush alternate.)**
####Create Database
1. Open browser and navigate to *localhost/phpMyAdmin*
2. Create new database called **newsite**

####Git Clone Site
1. Change to your sites directory: (Hopefully you created a symlink. If you didn’t then use `$ cd /var/www/html`):

    ```Bash
$ cd sites
```

2. Clone Drupal 7:
    
    ```Bash
$ git clone --branch 7.x http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git

###Alternate Database And Site Creation Using Command Line And Drush
####Create Database
1. Create a database, Replace database_name with the name of your choice.
    
    ```Bash
$ mysqladmin -u root -p create database_name
```

2. Enter your MySQL root password at the prompt.

---

####Create database user for site via command line
1. Open the mySQL client using root:
    
    ```Bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```

2. Enter your MySQL root password at the prompt.

3. Create a user:

    ```mySQL
mysql> CREATE USER 'name_of_new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password_of_new_user';
```

4. Grant *name_of_new_user* privileges to *database_name*:
    
    ```mySQL
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON 'database_name'.* TO 'name_of_new_user'@'localhost';
```

5. Reload the grant tables:
    
    ```mySQL
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

6. Exit mySQL
    
    ```mySQL
mysql> quit
```

---

###Create site via drush (works with Drupal 7, but still needs testing on Drupal 8)
1. Change to your sites directory: (Hopefully you created a symlink. If you didn’t then use $ cd /var/www/html):

    ```Bash
$ cd sites
```

2. Download Drupal (can also do drupal-8.x):

    ```Bash
$ drush dl drupal --drupal-project-rename=site_directory_name
```

3. Change to the site_directory_name
    
    ```Bash
$ cd site_directory_name
```

4. Drupal Site Install. This will also create your settings.php file:
    
    ```Bash
$ drush si standard --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin --db-url=mysql://database_user_name:database_user_password@localhost/database_name
```

---

###Get an old site up and running
####You will need:
1. Compressed database dump from old site in (mysql.zip or mysql.gz)
2. All of the files or ability to git clone the files of the old site 
** If you are not able to get a db dump and need to use backup and migrate module, Please follow a different set of directions, posted on page 10.

####Create database
1. Open browser and navigate to localhost/phpMyAdmin
2. Create new database for your site. Example: oldsite or old_site
3. Click on the newly created database
4. Choose import, navigate to the compressed db file (mysql.gz) and click go

####Configure Apache2 for the old site
1. Open the Hosts file:

    ```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

2. Add under the last line

    ```
# Drupal sites
127.0.0.1 oldsite.dev
```

3. Press **CTRL**+**o** (to save)

4. Press **Enter**

5. Press **CTRL**+**x** (to exit)

####Place the oldsite folder in /var/www/html (or git clone the oldsite to this folder)
1. Navigate to /sites (or /var/www/html if you didn’t create a symlink)
2. Change the name of your folder to **oldsite.dev** (basically we are adding .dev and making sure the name of this folder matches the oldsite.dev name in the hosts file)
3. Navigate into the sites/default folder and delete any old settings.php
4. Copy default.settings.php and rename it: **settings.php**

####Manually link your oldsite to the new database
1. Open the settings.php file:

    ```bash
$ sudo nano sites/default/settings.php
```

2. You can copy/paste this into settings.php around line 219. Look for:

    ```php
    $databases = array();
    
    $databases = array (
    
      'default' =>
    
      array (
    
        'default' =>
    
        array (
    
        'database' => 'DATABASENAME',
    
        'username' => 'root',
    
        'password' => 'root',
    
        'host' => 'localhost',
    
        'port' => '',
    
        'driver' => 'mysql',
    
        'prefix' => '',
    
       ),
    
     ),
    
   );
   ```  

3. Change `'database' => 'DATABASENAME',` to your oldsite database name
4. If your local phpMyAdmin has a different pw than root/root then change that too
5. Press **CTRL**+**o** (to save)
6. Press **Enter**
7. Press **CTRL**+**x** (to exit)

####Hope for the best! We all know that getting an old site up and running locally can be challenging
1. Navigate to localhost/oldsite.dev
2. You will need your old username/password as it is stored in the database to log in

---

###Specific Install for using backup_migrate module

---

###Common troubleshooting stuff when working with older sites
1. Reset the admin username/password (assuming admin is the username)
  1. cd to the root of your oldsite.dev
  2. Set username and password: 

    ```bash
$ drush user-password admin --password=newpassword
```

2. Only the front page shows, 404 on any other nodes
  1. Make sure there is an .htaccess file in the root of the site
    * If it is missing, simply copy/paste .htaccess into the root of your oldsite.dev from another drupal site
  2. If .htaccess is there and still having issues, check for clean urls
        2. In the browser, navigate to *localhost/oldsite.dev/?q=admin/config/search/clean-urls*
        3. There should be a checkmark and option to run clean urls
        4. For additional clean url troubleshooting: [https://www.drupal.org/node/15365](https://www.drupal.org/node/15365)
        5. In the meantime, you can still painfully navigate the site with /?q=
  3. Missing images
    * If you git cloned, your files folder will be empty. Grab the files folder from the old site and place in sites/default/
  4. White screen of death (WOD):

	```bash
$ drush updb
```

---

###Important drush command change
####Drupal 7:

```bash
	$ drush cc all
```

####Drupal 8:

```bash
	$ drush cr all
```

* Option 1 is the recommended method for the masses, as it should be stable and secure. 
* Options 2, 3, and 4 have the advantage of keeping your node and npm packages the most curren

####Option 1: Install the standard Debian/Ubuntu packages for “node” and “npm”.
1. To install Node.js, open a terminal and type the following command:

    ```bash
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

2. Then install the Node package manager called “npm”:

    ```bash
$ sudo apt-get install npm
```
3. Create a symbolic link for “node” as many Node.js tools use this name to execute.

    ```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

4. Now we should have both the node and npm commands working:

   ```bash
$ node -v
v0.10.25
```

   ```bash
   $ npm -v
   1.3.10
```

####Option 2: Install from Debian/Ubuntu packages created by the Node.js (associated) team.
The process below is described here, too.

1. Add the Node.js maintained repositories to your Ubuntu package source list with this command:

    ```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
```

2. Then install Node.js with apt-get:

    ```bash
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

3. Optionally we can create a symbolic link for “node” (for reasons mentioned earlier):

    ```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

4. Using this install option, we end up with newer versions of “nodejs” and “npm”:

    ```bash
$ node -v
v0.10.35
$ npm -v
1.4.28
```

####Option 3: Install Node.js manually from standard binary packages on the official website.
Go to the official Node.js download page and download either the 32-bit or 64-bit Linux binary file, depending on your system type.

1. You can check what CPU architecture your server has with these commands:

    ```bash
$ getconf LONG_BIT
64
$ uname -p
x86_64
```

2. You can download this file from the browser or from the console. The latter is shown below (note: the specific Node.js version might be different for you):

    ```bash
$ wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.0/node-v0.12.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

3. From a console window, go to the directory where the Node.js binary was downloaded to, and then execute the following command to install the Node.js binary package in “/usr/local/”:

    ```bash
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local --strip-components 1 -xzf node-v0.10.34-linux-x86.tar.gz
```

4. You should now have both node and npm installed in “/usr/local/bin”. You can check this typing:

    ```bash
$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/node
$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/npm
```

####Option 4: Install Node.js from the [Github source repository](https://github.com/joyent/node).
####Useful Note Regarding Older "node" Packages When Updating

On Ubuntu, the “nodejs” package has a similar name to the older one named “node”. The old one is an amateur packet radio program you can more than likely remove.

If you already have “node” installed, you might want to remove it. Some Node.js tools might execute Node.js as “node” instead of “nodejs” causing conflicts.

You can look for and remove the “node” package by executing these commands in a terminal. To access a terminal, navigate the desktop menu to: **Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal**.

Run this command and if it says “install” in the right column, “node” is on your system:

```bash
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep node
ax25-node                                       install
node                                            install
```

If you found the old “node” package installed, run this command to completely remove it:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get remove --purge node
```

###Gulp.js Streaming Build System
* **[Gulp Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)**
* **[Automated Theming Workflow With Gulp](http://www.blinkreaction.com/blog/automated-theming-workflow-with-gulp)**

1. Install gulp globally:

    ```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

2. Install gulp in your project devDependencies:

    ```sh
$ npm install --save-dev gulp
```

3. Create a `gulpfile.js` at the root of your project:

    ```js
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function() {
  // place code for your default task here
});
```

4. Run gulp:

    ```sh
$ gulp
```

The default task will run and do nothing.
To run individual tasks, use `gulp <task> <othertask>`.

#### Where do I go now?
You have an empty gulpfile and everything is installed. How do you REALLY get started? Check out the [recipes](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes) and the [list of articles](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/README.md#articles) for more information.
#### .src, .watch, .dest, CLI args - How do I use these things?
For API specific documentation you can check out the [documentation for that](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md).
#### Available Plugins
The gulp community is growing, with new plugins being added daily. See the [main website](http://gulpjs.com/plugins/) for a complete list.
